Track healthy organs in medical scans to improve cancer treatment



First competition in kaggle , get silver medal in LA ，but shark to bronze medal in LB:cry: seems due to 2.5D.

We trained 3D unet(nnunet) ,but don’t ensembling 3D model with a 2.5D model because the model didn’t perform well in LA,  we were too young to discard it and just use a 2.5D model with 5folds in final.

This competion opened my eyes,I got to know the base process to play kaggle, know the common trick ,discussion with others and teammates.

This repositories is to record the code in my competitions so it‘s messy.

The review is in the replay.pdf. The Ideas and abilities are worth learning.
